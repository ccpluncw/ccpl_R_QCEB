\usage{
addScenarioToQCEscenarioList(QCEScenarioList, QCEframeList, QCEfeebackList,
  QCEoutvariableList, setName)
}
\arguments{
\item{QCEScenarioList}{A list that specifies all the possible scenarios that participants might see. A scenario is, essentially, a trial.  It is composed of a series of frames, some potential response, and maybe feedback.  Included in each scenario are an output variable list to code in the datafile and a setName that is used for presentation rules (see trialStructure.json).  If you are building a new list, then this should be NULL. If you are adding a new effect to an old list, then this should be the QCEScenarioList that you are adding an effect to. DEFAULT = NULL}

\item{QCEframeList}{A list that specifies the frames to show a participant in a single scenario.  These frames are presented in succession: 1, 2, ... N.}

\item{QCEoutvariableList}{A list of variable names and their contents that will be output in the datafile for this trial.  DEFAULT = NULL.}

\item{setName}{A string that specifies the name of the set that this scenario belongs to.  Set names are used for selecting scenarios to show participants.  The rules are set in trialStructure.json.
