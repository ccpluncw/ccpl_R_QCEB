\title{This  function is used to create or modify a QCEframeList}
\usage{
addFrameToQCEframeList(
  QCEframeList = NULL,
  trialType = "key",
  frameName = NULL,
  stimulus = NULL,
  stimulus_duration = NULL,
  post_trial_gap = NULL,
  choices = NULL,
  background = "#000000",
  output = TRUE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{QCEframeList}{A list that specifies the frames to show a participant in a single scenario.  These frames are presented in succession: 1, 2, ... N.  If you are building a new list, then this should be NULL. If you are adding a new effect to an old list, then this should be the QCEframeList that you are adding an effect to. DEFAULT = NULL}

\item{trialType}{A string that specifies the response type that you will be collecting.  It can take on one of the following values: "key" or "textbox".  "key" indicates a key press or no input to move on to next frame. "textbox" indicates that a textbox will be presented for participants to input their text response. DEFAULT = "key"}

\item{frameName}{A string that specifies the name of the frame that will be output in the datafile, to indicate the data collected for this particular frame. One row is output in the datafile for each frame, so the frameName helps you keep track of the frame.  DEFAULT = NULL.  A NULL will force the frameName to equal "frame#" where # is the frame number.}

\item{stimulus_duration}{An integer that specifies how long to present the frame in milliseconds. A NULL will present the stimulus until their is a user input. DEFAULT = NULL}

\item{post_trial_gap}{An integer that specifies how long to present a blank frame after this frame in milliseconds. DEFAULT = NULL (indicating no gap)}

\item{choices}{A vector of characters or keyCodes that specifies the allowable keys to be accepted as a response.  If “choices” is NULL, then all keys are allowed.  “choices” should be NULL if trialType = textbox.  choices does not control the keys that can be pressed to input a value into the textbox.  That is controlled by the html input code used to create the textbox.  DEFAULT = NULL.}

\item{background}{an RGB color, specified in hexadecimal, that controls the background color of the frame page. DEFAULT = "#000000" (black).}

\item{stimulis}{A string that specifies the stimulus to be presented on this frame.  The stimulus must be in html format.  You can use any html codes. IMPORTANT: if the trialType = "key" you cannot have an input box of anykind.  If the trialType is "textbox" you must contain a textbox input field specified in html.  The fields for the html textbox MUST contain the following: <label id = TIN for="Text_In"> and     <input id ="Text_In" …> DEFAULT = NULL. A NULL will present a blank screen.}

\item{outut}{a boolean that specifies whether to output the data from the frame into the dataset. Manytimes frames such as fixation and mask frames do not need to be output. DEFAULT = TRUE.
