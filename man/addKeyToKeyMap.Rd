\title{This  function adds a key definition to a QCEkeyMap}
\usage{
addKeyToKeyMap(QCEkeyMap = NULL, keyMeaning, keys)
}
\arguments{
\item{QCEkeyMap}{A list that specifies the maping of the keys to their meaning for the experiment. If you are building a new list, then this should be NULL. If you are adding a new effect to an old list, then this should be the QCEkeyMap that you are adding an key definition to. DEFAULT = NULL}

\item{keyMeaning}{A single string that specifies the meaning of the keys. For example, in a target present/target absent experiment, the keyMeaning for one set of keys may be "targetPresent". DEFAULT = NULL}

\item{keys}{A vector of characters that specifies the keys that map to the keyMeaning.  Often these are a single key and it's capital. For example, c("d", "D"). DEFAULT = NULL
'}
