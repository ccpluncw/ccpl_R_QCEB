\usage{
buildQCEdbFile(expName = "defaultExpName", condName = "defaultCond",
  keyMap = NULL, randomizeKeyMap = FALSE,
  presentKeyMapAfterTrialNumbers = NULL,
  defaultBackgroundColor = "#000000", restAfterEveryNTrials = NULL,
  instructionFile = NULL, keyMapInstructionFile = NULL,
  getUserNameFile = NULL, getConsentFile = NULL,
  getDemographicsFile = NULL, getGenderFile = NULL,

  saveMsg = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{expName}{A string specifying the name of the experiment.  It will be output in a column in the datafile. DEFAULT = "defaultExpName"}

\item{condName}{A string specifying the condition of that this dbfile represents. It is really just a placeholder that you can use to code anything that you want. It will be output in a column in the datafile. DEFAULT = "defaultCond"}

\item{randomizeKeyMap}{a Boolean that specifies whether the maping of the keys to their meaning should be randomized everytime the experiment is run. This is useful if you want to randomize the key to meaning mapping for every subject on a single session experiment. DEFAULT = FALSE.}

\item{presentKeyMapAfterTrialNumbers}{An integer or vector of integers that specify when the participant will be reminded of the keyMap. The keyMap reminder message will show up after each trial number specified in the option.  So, if you want the keyMap reminder to show up after the first and fifth trial, the option should equal c(1,5). DEFAULT = NULL.  If NULL, then no reminder will be shown.}

\item{restAfterEveryNTrials}{An integer that specifies the number of trials to run between each break (e.g., 50). DEFAULT = NULL.  If NULL, then no break will be shown.}

\item{instructionFile}{A string that specifies the name of the html file that contains the instructions.  It will be shown at the begining of the experiment.  If this is NULL, then no instructions will be shown. DEFAULT = NULL.}

\item{keyMapInstructionFile}{A string that specifies the name of the html file that contains the mapping between the keys and their meaning (e.g., "Press the "d" key to indicate YES).  It will be shown at the begining of the experiment.  If this is NULL, then no keyMap instructions will be shown. DEFAULT = NULL.}

\item{getUserNameFile}{A string that specifies the name of the html file that collects the users identifying information (e.g., a random number).  It will be shown at the begining of the experiment.  If this is NULL, then this information will not be collected. DEFAULT = NULL.}

\item{getConsentFile}{A string that specifies the name of the html file that collects the users consent for participating.  It will be shown at the begining of the experiment.  If this is NULL, then this information will not be collected. DEFAULT = NULL.}

\item{getDemographicsFile}{A string that specifies the name of the html file that collects the users demongraphic information (e.g., age).  It will be shown at the begining of the experiment.  If this is NULL, then this information will not be collected. DEFAULT = NULL.}

\item{getGenderFile}{A string that specifies the name of the html file that collects the users gender information.  It will be shown at the begining of the experiment.  If this is NULL, then this information will not be collected. DEFAULT = NULL.}

\item{welcomeMsg}{A string that specifies the welcome message to be shown at the beginning of the experiment. The string must be in html format.  You can use any html codes.  DEFAULT = NULL. If NULL, then the following message will be presented, "Welcome to the experiment. Press any key to begin."}

\item{restMsg}{A string that specifies the rest message to be shown at the beginning of a break. The string must be in html format.  You can use any html codes.  DEFAULT = NULL. If NULL, then the following message will be presented, "Please take a self-timed break. Press any key to resume the experiment."}

\item{endOfExpMsg}{A string that specifies the end of experiment message to be shown at the end of the experiment. The string must be in html format.  You can use any html codes.  DEFAULT = NULL. If NULL, then the following message will be presented, "Thank you for taking part in the experiment."}

\item{saveMsg}{A string that specifies the data is saving message to be shown at the end of the experiment. The string must be in html format.  You can use any html codes.  DEFAULT = NULL. If NULL, then the following message will be presented, "Your data is being saved. Please do not close this window until you are told to.  Please press any key to continue."
'}

\item{QCEkeyMap}{A list that specifies the maping of the keys to their meaning for the experiment. DEFAULT = NULL}

\item{condName}{A string specifying the condition of that this dbfile represents. It is really just a placeholder that you can use to code anything that you want. It will be output in a column in the datafile. DEFAULT = "defaultCond"}
